# Data Audit Report In support of Predictive Model of Employee Voluntarily Turnover

Finding the main determining attribute which mainly affects the target sample from the selected qualifications merged from a vast dataset is considered to be the main objective of this Audit Report.

The analytical team has been asked by the SVP of Human Resources to build a predictive model to identify current employees who might be thinking to leave the company. The deliverable will be a scored file.

The target sample qualifications provided by the HR department are as follows: 

•	Former employees who voluntarily attritioned 

•	who took the survey

The non-target sample qualifications provided by the HR department are as follows:

•	Current employees

•	who took the survey.


The purpose of this data audit is to ensure that: 

• all data received by the analytical team for the project are consistent with the team’s understanding of the requested analytical deliverable; 

• that the team is reading and interpreting these data correctly; 

• that the team has received all data intended to be supplied; 

• that the data are functionally usable for modeling purposes. 


The data audit is broken into four main sections: 

1.	Dataset Summary – A list of all datasets received. 

2.	Dataset Detail – For each dataset, tables showing all data variables received. It is important that this section be reviewed to ensure that the analytical team has all the data sent, the data are being read correctly and the data have reasonable values. 

3.	Modeling Sample – Based on the requestor’s sample requirements, a determination is necessary as to whether adequate sample is available to support modeling. 

4.	Questions – Specific questions that the analytical team needs answered to ensure that the team fully understands the data and that the data can support the requested analytical deliverable.
